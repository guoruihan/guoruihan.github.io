  <p>
    Hello! I'm Ruihan Guo (郭睿涵), a research scientist at <a href="https://www.helixon.com/" target="_blank">Helixon</a>, specializing in antibody modeling and design.
  </p>
  <p>
    Prior to joining Helixon, I completed my undergraduate studies at the ACM Honors Class</a>, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (<a href="https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/">SJTU</a>) in June 2022, advised by <a href="https://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/members/yyu">Prof. Yong Yu</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    My research interests focus on protein structure prediction, molecular design, and the applications of machine learning and reinforcement learning in science. Currently, I am working on motif-controlled generation and interpretable protein design.

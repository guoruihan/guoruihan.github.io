    Atomic interactions are fundamental to molecular structures and functions.
    We constructed PocketXMol, an all-atom AI model, to learn these interactions
    for general pocket-interacting molecular generative tasks. PocketXMol unified
    distinct molecular tasks under a single computational framework without requiring fine-tuning. It was evaluated on 11 typical tasks, covering docking and
    design of small molecules and peptides, and compared against 49 baselines using
    45 metrics. PocketXMol outperformed state-of-the-art methods in 9 tasks and
    was competitive in the remaining ones. We successfully adopted PocketXMol to
    design novel small molecules to inhibit caspase-9 with efficacy comparable to
    commercial pan-caspase inhibitors. We also adopted PocketXMol to design PDL1-binding peptides and demonstrated its success rate 50,000 times higher than
    random library screening. Three peptides underwent rigorous cellular validation,
    exhibiting effective binding to the cell membrane. Their potential for molecular
    probing and therapy was further confirmed through injections in tumor mouse
    models and the ligand inhibition assay.

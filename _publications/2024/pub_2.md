  Peptides present distinct advantages in targeted therapy, including oral bioavailability, cellular permeability,
and high specificity, compared to conventional small molecules and biologics. In this work, we introduce a
novel AI-based model, PepMimic, to design peptide drug candidates by mimicking the binding interfaces
between targets and known binders. We employed PepMimic to design 384 peptides for each of
five targets:PD-L1, CD38, BCMA, HER2, and CD4. Of the 1,920 peptides generated, 8% exhibited
dissociation constant (KD) values at the 10−8M level, with 26 peptides achieving KD values as low as
10−9M. This success rate was 20,000 times higher than that observed in a random library screening
conducted under identical conditions. Additionally, PepMimic was applied to target proteins lacking
available structures of known binders by first utilizing AI algorithms to design protein binders, followed by
the generation of peptides through simulation of these artificial interfaces. This approach was tested
on TROP2 and CD38, where 14% of peptides reached KD values of 10−8M, with 5 peptides attaining
10−9M. The top-ranked peptides underwent extensive cellular validation and in vivo testing through tail
vein injections in breast, myeloma, and lung tumor mouse models. Experimental results demonstrated
effective membrane binding and highlighted the strong potential of these peptides for clinical diagnostic
imaging and targeted therapeutic applications.

abstract: >-
  PepMimic is an machine learning model for designing peptide drug candidates by mimicking binding interfaces, achieving dissociation constants as low as $10^{-9}$M with a success rate 20,000 times higher than random screening, and demonstrating therapeutic potential through extensive cellular and in vivo validations.

abstract: >-
  PepFlow introduces a multimodal deep generative model based on the flow-matching framework for full-atom peptide design, leveraging SE(3) manifolds and high-dimensional tori to model backbone orientations and side-chain dynamics, achieving state-of-the-art performance across peptide design tasks.

  PepHAR introduces a hot-spot-driven autoregressive generative model for peptide design, combining energy-based hot spot sampling, fragment-based extension, and iterative refinement to generate structurally valid peptides tailored to specific protein targets, demonstrating strong potential in computational peptide binder design.
